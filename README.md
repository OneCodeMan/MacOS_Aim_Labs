# MacOS_Aim_Labs
Attempt to create Aim Labs with SwiftUI

This is a project I'm parking for now or barely working on.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Headshot city mode -- fix overlapping targets
- [ ] Figure out how to play more than one audio file at once.
- [ ] Button to toggle music
- [ ] PAUSE state
- [ ] GAME OVER state
- [ ] Score system
- [ ] STATS!! (accuracy)

## Nice To Have
